## Running the code on a device/emulator
To run the software you need to download and install OpenCV to the project:
[https://opencv.org/android/](https://opencv.org/android/).
For OpenCV to work correctly you need to after unzipping import the directory as a module.
- File > New > Import Module
- Choose the source directory OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk
- Click Finish

It should now be able to run.

#### Limitations
The app is only a prototype.
There was not enough time to learn OpenCV well enough to build an app that could detect the door for real. Especially as we only realised that we couldn't use AR Core a week before the hand-in.
We got to a point were we could detect rectangles however the code was borrowed from another project and could not later be replicated in the final product.
The prototype should however give a general idea of how it could work.
